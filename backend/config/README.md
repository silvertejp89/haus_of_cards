# MySQL Docker Container - Projectarium

## Purpose

We use Docker to create an isolated MySQL environment for the **Haus of Cards** project. The container makes it easy to start and share the database among team members, and it can be reused for future projects within **Projectarium**.

## Instructions for Running the Container

### Container Settings

- **Container Name:** `projectarium-db`
- **Port Settings:**
  - **Host Port:** `3307`
  - **Container Port:** `3306`
- **Environment Variables:**
  - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password>`
  - `MYSQL_DATABASE=<your-database-name>`

---

## How to Use the Container

### Starting the Container

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Find the container `projectarium-db` in the **Containers** tab.
3. Click **Start** to run the container.

### Connecting to the Database

## Common Docker Commands

## Troubleshooting

### If `3307` is occupied

1. Stop the service using port `3307`, or
2. Use a different host port (e.g., `3308`) and update the settings.

### If the container doesnâ€™t run

1. Check the logs in Docker Desktop.
2. Verify that you have a functional Docker installation.

## Notes on Security

- Replace `<your-password>` and `<your-database-name>` with actual values in your local environment.
- Use a `.env` file to store sensitive data and reference it in your Docker setup:
  ```bash
  docker run --env-file .env ...
  ```
- Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to avoid uploading sensitive information to the repository.
